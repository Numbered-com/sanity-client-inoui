## [5.0.0](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/compare/v4.0.1...v5.0.0) (2023-02-02)

      ```

[The migration guide outlines every breaking change and how to migrate your code](https://github.com/sanity-io/client#from-v4)

### Features

- full Node.js ESM runtime support ([#86](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/issues/86)) ([bd9b247](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/commit/bd9b247f99ac513023581bfb1089b1892390d948)), closes [/github.com/sanity-io/client#from-v4](https://github.com/sanity-io//github.com/sanity-io/client/issues/from-v4)

## [4.0.1](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1) (2023-01-06)

### Bug Fixes

- **deps:** upgrade rxjs to v7 ([#80](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/issues/80)) ([594b4e7](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/commit/594b4e76253345bbaa678093b91faa101e240aee))

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/compare/v3.4.1...v4.0.0) (2023-01-02)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- Expanding ESM support is a significant change. Although a tremendous effort is made to preserve backward compatibility it can't be guaranteed as there are too many conditions, environments, and runtime versions to cover them all.

### Bug Fixes

- **deps:** update dependencies (non-major) ([#36](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/issues/36)) ([658b40f](https://github.com/sanity-io/client/commit/658b40fb51541eeb0b4313bd9aaef746eeb670d2))
